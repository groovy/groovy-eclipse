/**
 * This is a script to compute an updated list of exported packages for this bundle.
 * Run this simply as a Java application. It prints a list of all packages in the groovy-all jar.
 * Merged with any exported packages from the current MANIFEST.MF.
 * <p>
 * Paste this updated list into MANIFEST.MF to replace the old one. This ensures that there are
 * no osgi-hidden 'private' packages in groovy-all jar. These will cause problems with some
 * AST transforms accidentally picking up classes from the project's classpath instead of our
 * groovy-all jar.
 *
 * Note: this script is in a source folder compiled by eclipse, but isn't in build.properties. So
 * it won't be built by maven for CI and RELEASE builds. It is *not* part of Greclipse.
