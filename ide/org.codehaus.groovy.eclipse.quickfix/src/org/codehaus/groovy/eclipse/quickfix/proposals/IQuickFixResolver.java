/**
 * Groovy problems are handled by implementing a Quick Fix resolver, which is
 * associated with a group of problem types, meaning that a resolver can
 * potentially handle different Groovy problems, as well as provide a list of Java
 * completion proposals, in case the resolver is able to present different
 * options on how to resolve the same problem. There is no assumed or expected
 * mapping between each different type and each Java completion proposal.
 * <p>
 * In fact, the resolver should be defined against a set of problem types for
 * which the solution is the same. Therefore, for each problem type, the
 * list of Java completion proposals should be the same. If they are different,
 * then different resolvers should be implemented.
 *
