/**
 * Must be run in the UI thread. Performs add, edit and remove of suggestions in
 * a given project.
 * Adding and edit may optionally also include a context. For adding, the
 * context may be an existing
 * suggestion or declaring type. In either case, the declaring type of the
 * existing suggestion will
 * be used for the new suggestion (i.e. the suggestion may be added to that
 * declaring type). For editing,
 * the context values are edited and a new suggestion instance containing the
 * edited values is returned.
 * Note that even in the edit case, the original context suggestion is NOT
 * modified. A new instance of
 * a suggestion is returned even during an edit.
