/**
 * A pointcut that can be defined in a DSLD file.  A pointcut describes
 * <i>where</i> a contribution group should be applied.
 * <p>
 * An {@link IPointcut} instance may contain state, but they must be immutable once created.
 * Pointcut evaluation may be occurring simultaneously on multiple threads.
 * <p>
 * Here is the order in which the methods are called:
 * <ol>
 * <li> any number of {@link #addArgument(Object)} and {@link #addArgument(String, Object)}.
 *      but a pointcut must have only named or only unnamed arguments.  The two styles
 *      cannot be mixed
 * <li> {@link #verify()}.  If this method does not return an OK status, then the following methods are not called
 * <li> {@link #normalize()}  this method will reorganize this query and contained queries to make more efficient.
 *      after this method call, Poincuts are immutable
 * <li> {@link #matches(GroovyDSLDContext)}.  This method can be called any number of times and from different threads.
 *      It should not mutate state
 * <ol>
 *
 * There are several broad categories of pointcuts, each with their own expectactions:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Filtering pointcuts, which require a surrounding pointcut to pass some state in (eg- find field/method)
 * <li>Structural pointcuts, which depend on the lexical structure of the code (eg- enclosingClass)
 * <li>Layout pointcuts, which depend on invariant factors external to the current module (eg- location in project, or file name)
 * <li>Semantic pointcuts, which depend on inferencing (eg- currentType)
 * </ol>
 * Each category offers a different way to internally optimize
