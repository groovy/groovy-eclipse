/**
 * Represents a single field of a struct in the {@link Database}. Holds metadata for that field
 * and permits laziy initialization of the field offset. Fields are normally instantiated as static
 * variables. Collectively, they describe the database schema but they are not associated with any
 * particular instance of data in the database.
 * <p>
 * Fields are temporarily mutable. On construction, a number of attributes (such as offset) are
 * computed in a second pass or are initialized as other fields are constructed. Generally such
 * attributes can't be computed in the constructor since they depend on knowledge of other fields
 * that must be instantiated first. However, once {@link StructDef#done()} has been called on the
 * last {@link StructDef}, fields are immutable and should not ever be modified again.
