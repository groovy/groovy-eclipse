/**
 * Used to represent a single field of an object stored in the database. Objects 
 * which store themselves in the database should store a set of static final
 * FieldDefinitions at the top of their class definition to indicate their memory map.
 * This serves as a standard way to document the memory map for such structs, provides
 * access to the field offsets, and provides a convenience getter.
 * <p>
 * There are two ways to use this. Callers can either use the "get" method to access
 * the value of the field, or can use the public "offset" attribute to perform the reads
 * manually. The get function is more convenient but allocates objects and so should
 * probably not be used for frequently-accessed fields or primitive types that would
 * end up being autoboxed unnecessarily.
