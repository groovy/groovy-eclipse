/**
 * A search participant describes a particular extension to a generic search
 * mechanism, permitting combined search actions which will involve all required
 * participants.
 * <p>
 * A search participant is involved in the indexing phase and in the search phase.
 * The indexing phase consists in taking one or more search documents, parse them, and
 * add index entries in an index chosen by the participant. An index is identified by a
 * path on disk.
 * The search phase consists in selecting the indexes corresponding to a search pattern
 * and a search scope, from these indexes the search infrastructure extracts the document paths
 * that match the search pattern asking the search participant for the corresponding document,
 * finally the search participant is asked to locate the matches precisely in these search documents.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is intended to be subclassed by clients. During the indexing phase,
 * a subclass will be called with the following requests in order:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #scheduleDocumentIndexing(SearchDocument, IPath)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #indexDocument(SearchDocument, IPath)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * During the search phase, a subclass will be called with the following requests in order:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #selectIndexes(SearchPattern, IJavaSearchScope)}</li>
 * <li>one or more {@link #getDocument(String)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #locateMatches(SearchDocument[], SearchPattern, IJavaSearchScope, SearchRequestor, IProgressMonitor)}</li>
