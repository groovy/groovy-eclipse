 * Clients should subclass if they need to influence the
 * the source range to be affected when replacing or deleting a particular node.
 * An instance of the subclass should be registered with
 * {@link ASTRewrite#setTargetSourceRangeComputer(TargetSourceRangeComputer)}.
 * During a call to {@link ASTRewrite#rewriteAST(org.eclipse.jface.text.IDocument, java.util.Map)},
 * the {@link #computeSourceRange(ASTNode)} method on this object will be
