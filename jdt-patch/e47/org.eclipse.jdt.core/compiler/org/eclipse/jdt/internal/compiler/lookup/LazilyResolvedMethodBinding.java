/**
 * This represents a method binding whose parameter and return type we want to resolve lazily.  It is
 * currently intended for use representing the getX/setX and isX methods you would get for a groovy
 * property (it therefore only supports 0 or 1 parameter, it doesn't need to support more for now).
 * Upon finding the method is unresolved, the code in SourceTypeBinding.resolveTypesFor(MethodBinding)
 * would normally look for a method declaration from which to discover the parameter and return type
 * references.  There is no declaration corresponding to these property accessor bindings and so
 * there is an extra check in resolveTypesFor when the declaration is not found, if the binding
 * is determined to be a LazilyResolvedMethodBinding - we ask it for the parameter and return
 * types which it determines from the field binding for the property.  The key benefit here is that
 * the parameter/return type bindings are not chased down unless required.
