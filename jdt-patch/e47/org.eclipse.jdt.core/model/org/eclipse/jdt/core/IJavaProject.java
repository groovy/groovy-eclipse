/**
 * A Java project represents a view of a project resource in terms of Java
 * elements such as package fragments, types, methods and fields.
 * A project may contain several package roots, which contain package fragments.
 * A package root corresponds to an underlying folder or JAR.
 * <p>
 * Each Java project has a classpath, defining which folders contain source code and
 * where required libraries are located. Each Java project also has an output location,
 * defining where the builder writes <code>.class</code> files. A project that
 * references packages in another project can access the packages by including
 * the required project in a classpath entry. The Java model will present the
 * source elements in the required project; when building, the compiler will use
 * the corresponding generated class files from the required project's output
 * location(s)). The classpath format is a sequence of classpath entries
 * describing the location and contents of package fragment roots.
 * </p>
 * Java project elements need to be opened before they can be navigated or manipulated.
 * The children of a Java project are the package fragment roots that are
 * defined by the classpath and contained in this project (in other words, it
 * does not include package fragment roots for other projects). The children
 * (i.e. the package fragment roots) appear in the order they are defined by 
 * the classpath.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance of one of these handles can be created via
 * <code>JavaCore.create(project)</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see JavaCore#create(org.eclipse.core.resources.IProject)

	 * Sets the both the classpath of this project and its default output
	 * location at once. The classpath is defined using a list of classpath
	 * entries. In particular, such a classpath may contain classpath variable
	 * entries. Classpath variable entries can be resolved individually (see
	 * ({@link JavaCore#getClasspathVariable(String)}), or the full classpath can be
	 * resolved at once using the helper method
	 * {@link #getResolvedClasspath(boolean)}.
	 * <p>
	 * A classpath variable provides an indirection level for better sharing a
	 * classpath. As an example, it allows a classpath to no longer refer
	 * directly to external JARs located in some user specific location. The
	 * classpath can simply refer to some variables defining the proper
	 * locations of these external JARs.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Setting the classpath to <code>null</code> specifies a default classpath
	 * (the project root). Setting the classpath to an empty array specifies an
	 * empty classpath.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If a cycle is detected while setting this classpath, an error marker will
	 * be added to the project closing the cycle. To avoid this problem, use
	 * {@link #hasClasspathCycle(IClasspathEntry[])} before setting
	 * the classpath.

	 * This operation acquires a lock on the workspace's root.

	 * @param entries a list of classpath entries

	 * @exception JavaModelException if the classpath could not be set. Reasons
	 * include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> This Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
	 * <li> Two or more entries specify source roots with the same or overlapping paths (NAME_COLLISION)
	 * <li> A entry of kind <code>CPE_PROJECT</code> refers to this project (INVALID_PATH)
	 *  <li>This Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>

	 *	<li>The output location path is not an absolute path (<code>RELATIVE_PATH</code>)
	 *  <li>The output location path is nested inside a package fragment root of this project (<code>INVALID_PATH</code>)
	 * <li> The classpath is being modified during resource change event notification (CORE_EXCEPTION)
