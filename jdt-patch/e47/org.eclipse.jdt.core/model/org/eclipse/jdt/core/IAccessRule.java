/**
 * Describes an access rule to source and class files on a classpath entry.
 * An access rule is composed of a file pattern and a kind (accessible,
 * non accessible, or discouraged).
 * <p>
 * On a given classpath entry, the access rules are considered in the order given
 * when the entry was created. When a source or class file matches an access
 * rule's pattern, the access rule's kind defines whether the file is considered
 * accessible, non-accessible, or whether its access is discouraged. If the source or class
 * file doesn't match any access rule, it is considered accessible. A source or class
 * file that is not accessible or discouraged can still be referred to, but it is tagged as being not
 * accessible - the Java builder will create a problem marker, for example.
 * The severity of the marker created from a non-accessible rule is controlled through
 * the {@link JavaCore#COMPILER_PB_FORBIDDEN_REFERENCE} compiler option.
 * The severity of the marker created from a discouraged rule is controlled through
 * the {@link JavaCore#COMPILER_PB_DISCOURAGED_REFERENCE} compiler option.
 * Note this is different from inclusion and exclusion patterns on source classpath entries,
 * where a source file that is excluded is not even compiled.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Files patterns look like relative file paths with wildcards and are interpreted relative
 * to each entry's path.
 * File patterns are case-sensitive and they can contain '**', '*' or '?' wildcards (see
 * {@link IClasspathEntry#getExclusionPatterns()} for the full description
 * of their syntax and semantics).
 * Note that file patterns must not include the file extension.
 * <code>com/xyz/tests/MyClass</code> is a valid file pattern, whereas
 * <code>com/xyz/tests/MyClass.class</code> is not valid.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, if a classpath entry path is <code>/Project/someLib.jar</code>,
 * there are no accessible rules, and there is one non-accessible rule with pattern
 * <code>com/xyz/tests/&#42;&#42;</code>, then class files
 * like <code>/Project/someLib.jar/com/xyz/Foo.class</code>
 * and <code>/Project/someLib.jar/com/xyz/utils/Bar.class</code> would be accessible,
 * whereas <code>/Project/someLib.jar/com/xyz/tests/T1.class</code>
 * and <code>/Project/someLib.jar/com/xyz/tests/quick/T2.class</code> would not be
 * accessible.
