/**
 * Common protocol for Java elements that support working copies.
 * <p>
 * A working copy of a Java element acts just like a regular element (handle),
 * except it is not attached to an underlying resource. A working copy is not
 * visible to the rest of the Java model. Changes in a working copy's
 * buffer are not realized in a resource. To bring the Java model up-to-date with a working
 * copy's contents, an explicit commit must be performed on the working copy.
 * Other operations performed on a working copy update the
 * contents of the working copy's buffer but do not commit the contents
 * of the working copy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: The contents of a working copy is determined when a working
 * copy is created, based on the current content of the element the working
 * copy is created from. If a working copy is an <code>IOpenable</code> and is explicitly
 * closed, the working copy's buffer will be thrown away. However, clients should not
 * explicitly open and close working copies.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The client that creates a working copy is responsible for
 * destroying the working copy. The Java model will never automatically
 * destroy or close a working copy. (Note that destroying a working copy
 * does not commit it to the model, it only frees up the memory occupied by
 * the element). After a working copy is destroyed, the working copy cannot
 * be accessed again. Non-handle methods will throw a
 * <code>JavaModelException</code> indicating the Java element does not exist.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A working copy cannot be created from another working copy.
 * Calling <code>getWorkingCopy</code> on a working copy returns the receiver.
 * </p>
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link ICompilationUnit} instead
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
