/**
 * Completion proposal.
 * <p>
 * In typical usage, the user working in a Java code editor issues
 * a code assist command. This command results in a call to
 * <code>ICodeAssist.codeComplete(position, completionRequestor)</code>
 * passing the current position in the source code. The code assist
 * engine analyzes the code in the buffer, determines what kind of
 * Java language construct is at that position, and proposes ways
 * to complete that construct. These proposals are instances of
 * the class <code>CompletionProposal</code>. These proposals,
 * perhaps after sorting and filtering, are presented to the user
 * to make a choice.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The proposal is as follows: insert
 * the {@linkplain #getCompletion() completion string} into the
 * source file buffer, replacing the characters between
 * {@linkplain #getReplaceStart() the start}
 * and {@linkplain #getReplaceEnd() end}. The string
 * can be arbitrary; for example, it might include not only the
 * name of a method but a set of parentheses. Moreover, the source
 * range may include source positions before or after the source
 * position where <code>ICodeAssist.codeComplete</code> was invoked.
 * The rest of the information associated with the proposal is
 * to provide context that may help a user to choose from among
 * competing proposals.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The completion engine creates instances of this class.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see ICodeAssist#codeComplete(int, CompletionRequestor)
 * @since 3.0
 * @noinstantiate This class is not intended to be instantiated by clients.
 * @noextend This class is not intended to be subclassed by clients.
