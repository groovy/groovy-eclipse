/**
 * The <code>ICacheEnumeration</code> is used to iterate over both the keys
 * and values in an LRUCache.  The <code>getValue()</code> method returns the
 * value of the last key to be retrieved using <code>nextElement()</code>.
 * The <code>nextElement()</code> method must be called before the
 * <code>getValue()</code> method.
 *
 * <p>The iteration can be made efficient by making use of the fact that values in
 * the cache (instances of <code>LRUCacheEntry</code>), know their key.  For this reason,
 * Hashtable lookups don't have to be made at each step of the iteration.
 *
 * <p>Modifications to the cache must not be performed while using the
 * enumeration.  Doing so will lead to an illegal state.
