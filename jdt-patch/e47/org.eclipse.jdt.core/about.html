<h3>Disassembler</h3>
<p>This plug-in contains a bytecode disassembler (&quot;Disassembler&quot;) that can produce a listing of the Java assembler mnemonics (&quot;Assembler Mnemonics&quot;) for a Java method.  If you 
use the Disassembler to view the Assembler Mnemonics for a method, you should ensure that doing so will not violate the terms of any licenses that apply to your use of that method, as
such licenses may not permit you to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble method bytecodes.</p>
