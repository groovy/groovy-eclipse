/**
 * Returns a shared working copy on this compilation unit or class file using the given working copy owner to create

 * This API can only answer an already existing working copy if it is based on the same
 * original Java type root AND was using the same working copy owner (that is, as defined by {@link Object#equals}).
 * <p>
 * The life time of a shared working copy is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The first call to {@link #getWorkingCopy(WorkingCopyOwner, IProgressMonitor)}
 * 	creates a new working copy for this element</li>
 * <li>Subsequent calls increment an internal counter.</li>
 * <li>A call to {@link ICompilationUnit#discardWorkingCopy()} decrements the internal counter.</li>
 * <li>When this counter is 0, the working copy is discarded.
 * </ul>
 * So users of this method must discard exactly once the working copy.
 * <p>
 * Note that the working copy owner will be used for the life time of the shared working copy, that is if the
 * working copy is closed then reopened, this owner will be used.
 * The buffer will be automatically initialized with the original's Java type root content upon creation.
 * <p>
 * When the shared working copy instance is created, an ADDED IJavaElementDelta is reported on this
 * working copy.
 * </p><p>
 * A working copy can be created on a not-yet existing compilation unit.
 * In particular, such a working copy can then be committed in order to create
 * the corresponding compilation unit.
 * </p><p>
 * Note that possible problems of this working copy are reported using this method only
 * if the given working copy owner returns a problem requestor for this working copy
 * (see {@link WorkingCopyOwner#getProblemRequestor(ICompilationUnit)}).
 * </p>
 *
 * @param owner the working copy owner that creates a buffer that is used to get the content
 * 				of the working copy
 * @param monitor a progress monitor used to report progress while opening this compilation unit
 *                 or <code>null</code> if no progress should be reported
 * @throws JavaModelException if the contents of this element can
 *   	not be determined.
 * @return a new working copy of this Java type root using the given owner to create
