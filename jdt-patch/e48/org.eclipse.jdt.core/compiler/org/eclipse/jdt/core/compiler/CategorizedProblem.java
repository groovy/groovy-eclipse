/**
 * Richer description of a Java problem, as detected by the compiler or some of the underlying
 * technology reusing the compiler. With the introduction of <code>org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.CompilationParticipant</code>,
 * the simpler problem interface {@link IProblem} did not carry enough information to better
 * separate and categorize Java problems. In order to minimize impact on existing API, Java problems
 * are still passed around as {@link IProblem}, though actual implementations should explicitly
 * extend {@link CategorizedProblem}. Participants can produce their own problem definitions,
 * and given these are categorized problems, they can be better handled by clients (such as user
 * interface).
 * <p>
 * A categorized problem provides access to:
 * <ul>
 * <li> its location (originating source file name, source position, line number) </li>
 * <li> its message description </li>
 * <li> predicates to check its severity (error, warning, or info) </li>
 * <li> its ID : a number identifying the very nature of this problem. All possible IDs for standard Java
 * problems are listed as constants on {@link IProblem}. </li>
 * <li> its marker type : a string identifying the problem creator. It corresponds to the marker type
 * chosen if this problem was to be persisted. Standard Java problems are associated to marker
 * type "org.eclipse.jdt.core.problem"). </li>
 * <li> its category ID : a number identifying the category this problem belongs to. All possible IDs for
 * standard Java problem categories are listed in this class. </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note: the compiler produces IProblems internally, which are turned into markers by the JavaBuilder
 * so as to persist problem descriptions. This explains why there is no API allowing to reach IProblem detected
 * when compiling. However, the Java problem markers carry equivalent information to IProblem, in particular
 * their ID (attribute "id") is set to one of the IDs defined on this interface.
 * <p>
 * Note: Standard Java problems produced by Java default tooling will be subclasses of this class. Technically, most
 * API methods dealing with problems are referring to {@link IProblem} for backward compatibility reason.
 * It is intended that {@link CategorizedProblem} will be subclassed for custom problem implementation when
 * participating in compilation operations, so as to allow participant to contribute their own marker types, and thus
 * defining their own domain specific problem/category IDs.
 * <p>
 * Note: standard Java problems produced by Java default tooling will set the marker
 * <code> IMarker#SOURCE_ID</code> attribute to
 * <code> JavaBuilder#SOURCE_ID</code>; compiler
 * participants may specify the <code> IMarker#SOURCE_ID</code>
 * attribute of their markers by adding it to the extra marker attributes of the problems they generate;
 * markers resulting from compiler participants' problems that do not have the
 * <code> IMarker#SOURCE_ID</code> extra attribute set do not have the
 * <code> JavaBuilder#SOURCE_ID</code> attribute set either.
