/**
 * A type hierarchy provides navigations between a type and its resolved
 * supertypes and subtypes for a specific type or for all types within a region.
 * Supertypes may extend outside of the type hierarchy's region in which it was
 * created such that the root of the hierarchy is always included. For example, if a type
 * hierarchy is created for a <code>java.io.File</code>, and the region the hierarchy was
 * created in is the package fragment <code>java.io</code>, the supertype
 * <code>java.lang.Object</code> will still be included. As a historical quirk,
 * <code>java.lang.Object</code> has always been included in type hierarchies
 * created on interface types.
 * <p>
 * A type hierarchy is static and can become stale. Although consistent when
 * created, it does not automatically track changes in the model.
 * As changes in the model potentially invalidate the hierarchy, change notifications
 * are sent to registered <code>ITypeHierarchyChangedListener</code>s. Listeners should
 * use the <code>exists</code> method to determine if the hierarchy has become completely
 * invalid (for example, when the type or project the hierarchy was created on
 * has been removed). To refresh a hierarchy, use the <code>refresh</code> method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The type hierarchy may contain cycles due to malformed supertype declarations.
 * Most type hierarchy queries are oblivious to cycles; the <code>getAll* </code>
 * methods are implemented such that they are unaffected by cycles.
 * </p>
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
