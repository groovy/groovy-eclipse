/**
 * A compilation participant is notified of events occurring during the compilation process.
 * The compilation process not only involves generating .class files (i.e. building), it also involves
 * cleaning the output directory, reconciling a working copy, etc.
 * So the notified events are the result of a build action, a clean action, a reconcile operation
 * (for a working copy), etc.
 * <p>
 * Code that participates in the build should in general be implemented with a separate Builder,
 * rather than a CompilationParticipant. It is only necessary to use a CompilationParticipant if
 * the build step needs to interact with the Java build, for instance by creating additional
 * Java source files that must themselves in turn be compiled.
 * <p>
 * Clients wishing to participate in the compilation process must subclass this class, and implement
 * {@link #isActive(IJavaProject)}, {@link #aboutToBuild(IJavaProject)},
 * {@link #reconcile(ReconcileContext)}, etc.
* </p><p>
 * This class is intended to be subclassed by clients.
