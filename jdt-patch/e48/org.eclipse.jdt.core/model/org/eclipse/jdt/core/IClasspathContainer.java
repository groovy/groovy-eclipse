/**
 * Interface of a classpath container.
 * A classpath container provides a way to indirectly reference a set of classpath entries through
 * a classpath entry of kind <code>CPE_CONTAINER</code>. Typically, a classpath container can
 * be used to describe a complex library composed of multiple JARs or projects, considering also
 * that containers can map to different set of entries on each project, in other words, several
 * projects can reference the same generic container path, but have each of them actually bound
 * to a different container object.
 * <p>
 * The set of entries associated with a classpath container may contain any of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li> library entries (<code>CPE_LIBRARY</code>) </li>
 * <li> project entries (<code>CPE_PROJECT</code>) </li>
 * </ul>
 * In particular, a classpath container can neither reference further classpath containers or classpath variables.
 * <p> 
 * A library entry can reference other libraries through the Class-Path section of the JAR's MANIFEST.MF file. If the
 * container wants such referenced entries to be part of the classpath, the container must explicitly add them to the
 * array returned from {@link #getClasspathEntries()}.
 * <p>
 * Classpath container values are persisted locally to the workspace, but are not preserved from a
 * session to another. It is thus highly recommended to register a <code>ClasspathContainerInitializer</code>
 * for each referenced container (through the extension point "org.eclipse.jdt.core.ClasspathContainerInitializer").
 * <p>
 * @see IClasspathEntry

	 * The set of entries associated with a classpath container may contain any of the following:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> library entries (<code>CPE_LIBRARY</code>) </li>
	 * <li> project entries (<code>CPE_PROJECT</code>) </li>

	 * or classpath variables.

	 * A library entry can reference other libraries through the Class-Path section of the JAR's MANIFEST.MF file. If
	 * the container wants such referenced entries to be part of the classpath, the container must explicitly add them
	 * to the result.
	 * <p>
	 * This method is called by the Java model when it needs to resolve this
	 * classpath container entry into a list of library and project entries.
	 * The method is typically called exactly once for a given Java project,
	 * and the resulting list of entries cached internally by the Java model.
	 * This method must not be called by other clients.
	 * <p>
	 * There are a wide variety of conditions under which this method may be
	 * invoked. To ensure that the implementation does not interfere with
	 * correct functioning of the Java model, the implementation should use
	 * only the following Java model APIs:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#newLibraryEntry(IPath, IPath, IPath, boolean)} and variants</li>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#newProjectEntry(IPath, boolean)} and variants</li>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#create(org.eclipse.core.resources.IWorkspaceRoot)}</li>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#create(org.eclipse.core.resources.IProject)}</li>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#getReferencedClasspathEntries(IClasspathEntry, IJavaProject)} with <code>null</code> as project</li>
	 * <li>{@link IJavaModel#getJavaProjects()}</li>
	 * <li>{@link IJavaProject#getRawClasspath()}</li>
	 * <li>{@link IJavaProject#readRawClasspath()}</li>
	 * <li>{@link IJavaProject#getOutputLocation()}</li>
	 * <li>{@link IJavaProject#readOutputLocation()}</li>
	 * <li>Java element operations marked as "handle-only"</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * The effects of using other Java model APIs are unspecified.
