 * A buffer contains the text contents of a resource. It is not language-specific.
 * The contents may be in the process of being edited, differing from the actual contents of the
 * underlying resource. A buffer has an owner, which is an <code>IOpenable</code>.
 * If a buffer does not have an underlying resource, saving the buffer has no effect.
 * Buffers can be read-only.
 * <p>
 * Note that java model operations that manipulate an <code>IBuffer</code> (for example,
 * <code>IType.createMethod(...)</code>) ensures that the same line delimiter
 * (either <code>"\n"</code> or <code>"\r"</code> or <code>"\r\n"</code>) is
 * used across the whole buffer. Thus these operations may change the line delimiter(s)
 * included in the string to be append, or replaced.
 * However implementers of this interface should be aware that other clients of <code>IBuffer</code>
 * might not do such transformations beforehand.
 * <p>
 * This interface may be implemented by clients.
