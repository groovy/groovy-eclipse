 * A type binding represents a fully-resolved type. There are a number of

 * <ul>
 * <li>a class - represents the class declaration;
 * possibly with type parameters</li>
 * <li>an interface - represents the class declaration;
 * possibly with type parameters</li>
 * <li>an enum - represents the enum declaration (enum types do not have
 * have type parameters)</li>
 * <li>an annotation - represents the annotation type declaration
 * (annotation types do not have have type parameters)</li>
 * <li>an array type - array types are referenced but not explicitly
 * declared</li>
 * <li>a primitive type (including the special return type <code>void</code>)
 * - primitive types are referenced but not explicitly declared</li>
 * <li>the null type - this is the special type of <code>null</code></li>
 * <li>a type variable - represents the declaration of a type variable;
 * possibly with type bounds</li>
 * <li>a wildcard type - represents a wild card used as a type argument in
 * a parameterized type reference</li>
 * <li>a raw type - represents a legacy non-parameterized reference to
 * a generic type</li>
 * <li>a parameterized type - represents an copy of a type declaration
 * with substitutions for its type parameters</li>
 * <li>a capture - represents a capture binding</li>
