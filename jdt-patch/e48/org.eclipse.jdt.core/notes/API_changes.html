<hr><h1>New API on <code>org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.AST</code></h1>
	(in progress) Last edit: 2003/07/18
<h2>Problem description</h2>
	Creating an DOM/AST for a compilation unit costs a lot when the user wants only a subpart
	of the compilation unit to be populated. For example, only the statements of one method are
	useful and there is no need to create the statements of the other methods.
	<p>
	See also <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=40474 ">bug 40474</a>.
	</p>
<h2>Problem resolution</h2>
	Two new APIs have been added on <code>org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.AST</code>.<br>
	<ul>
	<li><pre><code>public static org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.CompilationUnit parsePartialCompilationUnit(
		org.eclipse.jdt.core.ICompilationUnit unit,
		int position,
		boolean resolveBindings)</code>
		</pre>
	</li>
	<li><pre><code>public static org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.CompilationUnit parsePartialCompilationUnit(
		org.eclipse.jdt.core.ICompilationUnit unit,
		int position,
		boolean resolveBindings,

		</pre>
	</ul>
<h2>Converting to the new API</h2>
	None.

<hr><h1>IWorkingCopy is removed</h1>
	(in progress) Last edit: 2003/07/03
<h2>Problem description</h2>
	Historically, <code>IWorkingCopy</code> gathered all working copy concerns, 
	and <code>ICompilationUnit</code> implement this interface, though only the 
	factory method makes sense for them; thus their implementation of the working 
	copy features do nothing relevant to clients. <code>IWorkingCopy</code> also 
	implements the spec'ed factory method, but it doesn't work for these.
	<p>
	See also <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36987 ">bug 36987</a>.
	</p>
<h2>Problem resolution</h2>
	Interface <code>IWorkingCopy</code> is removed and all its functionality is moved to <code>ICompilationUnit</code>.
<h2>Converting to the new API</h2>
	Clients using <code>IWorkingCopy</code> and <code>ICompilationUnit</code> can
	adapt to this change by referencing <code>ICompilationUnit</code> instead of 
	<code>IWorkingCopy</code> when a working copy is needed.

<hr><h1>Working copy factory methods return ICompilationUnit</h1>
	(in progress) Last edit: 2003/07/03
<h2>Problem description</h2>
	Working copies were initialy designed to be editable elements on any <code>IJavaElement</code>.
	Pratice showed that they were used only to edit <code>ICompilationUnit</code>. This imposed 
	downcasting to <code>IWorkingCopy</code> when using the working copy factory methods.
<h2>Problem resolution</h2>
	Factory methods that create <code>ICompilationUnits</code> (i.e. 
	<code>getWorkingCopy</code>) now return an <code>ICompilationUint</code> instead of an 
	<code>IJavaElement</code>.
<h2>Converting to the new API</h2>
	Clients using factory methods to create working copies can now remove the cast from 
	<code>IJavaElement</code> to <code>IWorkingCopy</code>, <code>ICompilationUint</code>
	being compatible with <code>IWorkingCopy</code>.

<hr><h1>CharOperation.pathMatch(...) treats non absolute pattern as Ant does</h1>
	Last edit: 2003/06/11 (-&gt;M2)
<h2>Problem description</h2>
	<code>CharOperation.pathMatch(...)</code> used to treat non absolute pattern <code>'foo'</code>
	as <code>'**/foo'</code> for free. This was inconsistent with Ant patternset rules.
<h2>Problem resolution</h2>
	<code>CharOperation.pathMatch(...)</code> no longer treat non absolute pattern <code>'foo'</code>
	as <code>'**/foo'</code> for free. This has no incidence on
	source folder exclusion patterns which are implicitely concatenating exclusion patterns to source folder
	paths when using them. Only direct clients to this <code>CharOperation</code> API will be affected.

<hr><h1>Allow empty path to be equivalent to no source attachment</h1>
	Last edit: 2003/06/13 (-&gt;M2)
<h2>Problem description</h2>
	<code>JavaCore.newLibraryEntry(...)</code> used to not allow an empty source attachment (
	<code>new Path("")</code>) to be equivalent to no source attachment (i.e. <code>null</code>). 
	This adjustment is made necessary for library entries generated from classpath variables which cannot be set to 
	<code>null</code>. Also see bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38531">38531</a>.
<h2>Problem resolution</h2>
	<code>JavaCore.newLibraryEntry(...)</code> will now allow an empty source attachment (

	To generalize the usage of a working copy owner (entire JavaModel is now aware of owned working copies), new
	APIs were added. These new APIs are copies of existing APIs augmented with a <code>WorkingCopyOwner</code> 
	parameter, that defines the working copies to consider in the operation. 
	When specifying an owner parameter, all working copies belonging to this owner will implicitly take precedence over primary ones
	(without requiring the owner to remember all its working copies, as in 2.1 era). Note that when no owned working copy is found, a primary
	unit will be considered instead, and since primary units have a built-in working copy (see <code>ICompilationUnit.becomeWorkingCopy(...)</code>),
	the primary unit may already be in working copy mode (very likely since an editor got opened on it). This means that an owner will already 
	transparently see unsaved editor contents for all units for which it has no better working copy to contribute.
	The following new APIs were added:
	<ul>
		<li><code>AST.parseCompilationUnit(char[] source, String unitName, IJavaProject project, WorkingCopyOwner owner)</code></li>
		<li><code>AST.parseCompilationUnit(IClassFile classFile, boolean resolveBindings, WorkingCopyOwner owner)</code></li>

<hr><h1>JavaCore.newLibraryEntry(...) no longer accepts a relative source attachment path</h1>
	Last edit: 2003/06/30 (-&gt;M2)
<h2>Problem description</h2>
	The API <code>JavaCore.newLibraryEntry(IPath path, IPath sourceAttachmentPath, IPath sourceAttachmentRootPath, boolean isExported)</code> 
	for creating a library classpath entry with a source attachment used to accept a relative source attachment path. It was spec'ed as such, 
	but its implementation was too permissive.
<h2>Problem resolution</h2>
	From 3.0 on, an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> will be raised if a non-relative source attachment path is provided. 
	Note that the only exception to this rule is an empty path (answering <code>true</code> to <code>IPath.isEmpty()</code>) which is 
	now automatically translated into <code>null</code> denoting no source attachment.
	In 3.0, a .classpath file will compact source attachments into project relative ones (as it does with other entry pathes already). During 
	this process, relative pathes are known to be meaning project relative (internally when reading/writing the .classpath file). Externally, 
	only absolute pathes are allowed to avoid confusion when reading/writing the .classpath file.
	The tolerance for empty relative pathes comes from the fact that it is possible for variable classpath entries can be resolved to library entries 
	with no classpath. Then the variable source attachment needs to be positionned to a value meaning no source (<code>null</code>). 
	However, assigning a classpath variable to <code>null</code> is not allowed (nullification is used to remove variables),
	thus an empty relative source path is tolerated to work around this limitation.

<h2>Problem description</h2>
In 2.0 it was allowed to access IJavaProject.getOutputLocation/getRawClasspath on a project where the JavaNature was not set yet. Since 2.1 a
JavaModelException is thrown if that happens.
For example, the new Java project wizard does this if a .classpath file is found at the
location where the project will be created.
<h2>Problem resolution</h2>

	Added API <code>IJavaProject#readRawClasspath()</code> to allow user to read the raw classpath from <code>.classpath</code> disk file

 * However, if the file is modified within an operation, where this change needs to be taken into account before the

 * using <code>setRawClasspath(...)</code>.
 * 
 * The default output location is where class files are ordinarily generated
 * (and resource files, copied). Each source classpath entry can also
 * specify an output location for the generated class files (and copied
 * resource files) corresponding to compilation units under that source
 * folder. This makes it possible to arrange generated class files for
 * different source folders in different output folders, and not
 * necessarily the default output folder. This means that the generated
 * class files for the project may end up scattered across several folders,
 * rather than all in the default output folder (which is more standard).
