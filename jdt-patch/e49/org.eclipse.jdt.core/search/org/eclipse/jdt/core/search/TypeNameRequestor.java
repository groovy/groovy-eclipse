	 *          the enclosing types are [A, B]. This is an empty array if the type
	 *          is a top-level type.

	 *          or a source file, this is the full path in the workspace to this resource. If the
	 *          resource is an archive (that is, a .zip or .jar file), the path is composed of 2 paths separated
	 *		 	 by <code>IJavaSearchScope.JAR_FILE_ENTRY_SEPARATOR</code>:
	 *			 the first path is the full OS path to the archive (if it is an external archive),
	 *			 or the workspace relative <code>IPath</code> to the archive (if it is an internal archive),
	 * 		 the second path is the path to the resource inside the archive.
