 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * lookup3.c, by Bob Jenkins, May 2006, Public Domain.
 *
 * These are functions for producing 32-bit hashes for hash table lookup.
 * hashword(), hashlittle(), hashlittle2(), hashbig(), mix(), and final()
 * are externally useful functions.  Routines to test the hash are included
 * if SELF_TEST is defined.  You can use this free for any purpose.  It's in
 * the public domain.  It has no warranty.
 *
 * You probably want to use hashlittle().  hashlittle() and hashbig()
 * hash byte arrays.  hashlittle() is is faster than hashbig() on
 * little-endian machines.  Intel and AMD are little-endian machines.
 * On second thought, you probably want hashlittle2(), which is identical to
 * hashlittle() except it returns two 32-bit hashes for the price of one.
 * You could implement hashbig2() if you wanted but I haven't bothered here.
 *
 * If you want to find a hash of, say, exactly 7 integers, do
 *   a = i1;  b = i2;  c = i3;
 *   mix(a, b, c);
 *   a += i4; b += i5; c += i6;
 *   mix(a, b, c);
 *   a += i7;
 *   finalMix(a, b, c);
 * then use c as the hash value.  If you have a variable length array of
 * 4-byte integers to hash, use hashword().  If you have a byte array (like
 * a character string), use hashlittle().  If you have several byte arrays, or
 * a mix of things, see the comments above hashlittle().
 *
 * Why is this so big?  I read 12 bytes at a time into 3 4-byte integers,
 * then mix those integers.  This is fast (you can do a lot more thorough
 * mixing with 12*3 instructions on 3 integers than you can with 3 instructions
 * on 1 byte), but shoehorning those bytes into integers efficiently is messy.

	 * This is reversible, so any information in a, b, c before mix() is

     * If four pairs of a, b, c inputs are run through mix(), or through
	 * mix() in reverse, there are at least 32 bits of the output that
	 * are sometimes the same for one pair and different for another pair.
	 * This was tested for:
	 * * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
	 *   of top bits of a, b, c, or in any combination of bottom bits of
	 *   a, b, c.
	 * * "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
	 *   the output delta to a Gray code (a ^ (a >> 1)) so a string of 1's
	 *   (as is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
	 *   difference.
	 * * the base values were pseudo-random, all zero but one bit set, or
	 *   all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.
     *
	 * Some k values for my "a -= c; a ^= Integer.rotateLeft(c, k); c += b;"
	 * arrangement that satisfy this are
	 *     4  6  8 16 19  4
	 *     9 15  3 18 27 15
	 *    14  9  3  7 17  3
	 * Well, "9 15 3 18 27 15" didn't quite get 32 bits diffing
	 * for "differ" defined as + with a one-bit base and a two-bit delta.
	 * I used https://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/avalanche.html to choose
	 * the operations, constants, and arrangements of the variables.
     *
	 * This does not achieve avalanche.  There are input bits of a, b, c
	 * that fail to affect some output bits of a, b, c, especially of a.
	 * The most thoroughly mixed value is c, but it doesn't really even
	 * achieve avalanche in c.
     *
	 * This allows some parallelism.  Read-after-writes are good at doubling
	 * the number of bits affected, so the goal of mixing pulls in the opposite
	 * direction as the goal of parallelism.  I did what I could.  Rotates
	 * seem to cost as much as shifts on every machine I could lay my hands
	 * on, and rotates are much kinder to the top and bottom bits, so I used
	 * rotates.
