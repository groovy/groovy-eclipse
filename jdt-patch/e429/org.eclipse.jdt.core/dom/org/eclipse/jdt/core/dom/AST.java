/**
 * Umbrella owner and abstract syntax tree node factory.
 * An <code>AST</code> instance serves as the common owner of any number of
 * AST nodes, and as the factory for creating new AST nodes owned by that
 * instance.
 * <p>
 * Abstract syntax trees may be hand constructed by clients, using the
 * <code>new<i>TYPE</i></code> factory methods to create new nodes, and the
 * various <code>set<i>CHILD</i></code> methods
 * (see {@link org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.ASTNode ASTNode} and its subclasses)
 * to connect them together.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each AST node belongs to a unique AST instance, called the owning AST.
 * The children of an AST node always have the same owner as their parent node.
 * If a node from one AST is to be added to a different AST, the subtree must
 * be cloned first to ensures that the added nodes have the correct owning AST.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There can be any number of AST nodes owned by a single AST instance that are
 * unparented. Each of these nodes is the root of a separate little tree of nodes.
 * The method <code>ASTNode.getRoot()</code> navigates from any node to the root
 * of the tree that it is contained in. Ordinarily, an AST instance has one main
 * tree (rooted at a <code>CompilationUnit</code>), with newly-created nodes appearing
 * as additional roots until they are parented somewhere under the main tree.
 * One can navigate from any node to its AST instance, but not conversely.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class {@link ASTParser} parses a string
 * containing a Java source code and returns an abstract syntax tree
 * for it. The resulting nodes carry source ranges relating the node back to
 * the original source characters.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Compilation units created by <code>ASTParser</code> from a
 * source document can be serialized after arbitrary modifications
 * with minimal loss of original formatting. Here is an example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * Document doc = new Document("import java.util.List;\nclass X {}\n");
 * ASTParser parser = ASTParser.newParser(AST.JLS3);
 * parser.setSource(doc.get().toCharArray());
 * CompilationUnit cu = (CompilationUnit) parser.createAST(null);
 * cu.recordModifications();
 * AST ast = cu.getAST();
 * ImportDeclaration id = ast.newImportDeclaration();
 * id.setName(ast.newName(new String[] {"java", "util", "Set"});
 * cu.imports().add(id); // add import declaration at end
 * TextEdit edits = cu.rewrite(document, null);
 * UndoEdit undo = edits.apply(document);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * See also {@link org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.rewrite.ASTRewrite} for
 * an alternative way to describe and serialize changes to a
 * read-only AST.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may create instances of this class using {@link #newAST(int, boolean)},
 * but this class is not intended to be subclassed.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see ASTParser
 * @see ASTNode
 * @since 2.0
 * @noinstantiate This class is not intended to be instantiated by clients.
