The Java model is the set of classes that model the
objects associated with creating, editing, and building a Java program.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>

<p><br>This package contains the Java model classes, which implement Java
specific behaviour for resources and further decompose Java resources into
model elements.
</p><p>
Note that a lot of Java model operations require a Java project's classpath resolution.
For example IJavaProject#getResolvedClasspath(boolean) or JavaCore#setClasspathContainer()
will require to resolve the classpath of one or more projects. Client should be aware that
this resolution may require to take project modification rule 
(see IResourceRuleFactory#modifyRule(IResource)).
