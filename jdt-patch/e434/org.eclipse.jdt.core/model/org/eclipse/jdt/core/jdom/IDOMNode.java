/**
 * Nodes represent structural fragments of a Java source file, also known as document fragments. Their implementation
 * is known as a DOM (Document Object Model) -  in this case a JDOM (Java DOM). A root node (node
 * with no parent or siblings) represents the root of a document fragment (DF). A complete Java document is
 * represented by a compilation unit node (<code>IDOMCompilationUnit</code>). In this way, a DF is
 * comprised of DFs, and a document itself (compilation unit) is also a DF.
 * <p>
 * A DF may be created empty and programmatically filled, or it may be created from
 * a source code string. The <code>IDOMFactory</code> allows the creation of all kinds
 * of nodes from source code strings. Manipulations performed on a DF are immediately
 * reflected in the DF's contents.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Children fragments are represented as a linked list of nodes. Children are inserted via their parent node, and
 * are automatically linked up with previous and next nodes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The contents of any node (DF) may be retrieved at any time. In this way it is possible to retrieve
 * source code representing fragments of the compilation unit (for example, a type or a method), since
 * the contents of any node (not just the root node) may be obtained.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following manipulations on DFs are distinct:
 * <ul>
 * <li>clone - this creates a stand-alone copy of the DF that is in no way dependent on the DF that it was cloned from</li>
 * <li>remove - this orphans a DF from its host DF. The removed DF may still be dependent on its previous host
 *    (perhaps to generate its contents), and hanging onto the fragment means that its previous host is also
 *    retained in memory.</li>
 * <li>add/insert - this splices an un-parented DF (one that has been cloned, removed, or created stand-alone),
 *    into an existing DF such that the newly inserted DF is only dependent on its new host.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Wherever types are specified in DOM APIs, type names must be specified as they would appear
 * in source code. The DOM does not have a notion of type signatures, only raw text. Example type
 * names are <code>"Object"</code>, <code>"java.io.File"</code>, and <code>"int[]"</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * @deprecated The JDOM was made obsolete by the addition in 2.0 of the more
 * powerful, fine-grained DOM/AST API found in the
 * org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom package.
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
