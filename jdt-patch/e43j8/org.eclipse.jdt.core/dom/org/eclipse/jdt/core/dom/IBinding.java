	 *   type, and the keys of the parameter types</li>
	 * <li>constructors - the key of its declaring class, and the

	 *   block relative to its parent, the key of its method</li>

	 * <li>wildcard types - the key of the optional wildcard type bound</li>
     * <li>capture type bindings - the key of the wildcard captured</li>

	 * of the type arguments used to instantiate it, and whether the
